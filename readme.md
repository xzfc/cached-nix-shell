`cached-nix-shell` is a caching layer for `nix-shell` featuring instant startup time on subsequent runs.

It supports NixOS and Linux.

## Installation

Install the release version from Nixpkgs:
```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.cached-nix-shell
```

Or, install the latest development version from GitHub:
```sh
nix-env -if https://github.com/xzfc/cached-nix-shell/tarball/master
```

## Usage

Just replace `nix-shell` with `cached-nix-shell` in the shebang line:

```python
#! /usr/bin/env cached-nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Alternatively, call `cached-nix-shell` directly:

```sh
$ cached-nix-shell ./hello.py
$ cached-nix-shell -p python3 --run 'python --version'
```

Or use the `--wrap` option for programs that call `nix-shell` internally.

```sh
$ cached-nix-shell --wrap stack build
```

## Performance

```
$ time ./hello.py # first run; no cache used
cached-nix-shell: updating cache
Hello, World!
./hello.py  0.33s user 0.06s system 91% cpu 0.435 total
$ time ./hello.py
Hello, World!
./hello.py  0.02s user 0.01s system 97% cpu 0.029 total
```

## Caching and cache invalidation

`cached-nix-shell` stores environment variables set up by `nix-shell` and reuses them on subsequent runs.
It [traces](./nix-trace) which files are read by `nix` during an evaluation, and performs a proper cache invalidation if any of the used files are changed.
The cache is stored in `~/.cache/cached-nix-shell/`.

The following situations are covered:

* `builtins.readFile` is used
* `builtins.readDir` is used
* `import ./file.nix` is used
* updating `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`
* updating nix channels
* updating `$NIX_PATH` environment variable

The following situations aren't handled by `cached-nix-shell` and may lead to staled cache:

* `builtins.fetchurl` or other network builtins are used (e.g. in [nixpkgs-mozilla])
